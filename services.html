                <h2>Couch on the roof!</h2>
                <p>I ask you this, what better way to spend your afternoon than taking professional photos on the roof with your roommates? Purchase a subscription to Ran Ranch for a low monthly price of only $19.99/month* and you too could find a couch and five pajama clad guys on your roof**!</p>
                <br>
                <small>*Guys will not stay on roof or arrive at a scheduled time. May or may not make a lot of noise clambering onto roof, we advise you tell the children it is Santa Claus. Gifts to complete the charade not included. <br>**All liability will fall to the homeowner, request at your own risk.</small>

                <p>We provide more beignets than any group could possibly eat*! Soft, flaky, doused in powdered sugar with some honey drizzled on top, this sweet treat is sure to hit the spot. Full disclosure, you will become covered in a fine white powder**, plan accordingly and do not breath it in!</p>
                <br>
                <small>*No refunds or exchanges. This premium feature is not included in your Ran Ranch subscription. Assuming less than 10 beignets per person. If someone at your gathering eats more than that and you run out, that is a personal problem. Seriously, you should get that checked out.

                <p>The walls speak at Ran Ranch, because they are covered with post-it-notes featuring messages from those who have visited in the past! Subscribers need only write a message and smack it on the nearest object. If you find yourself non-corporeal, never fear! We also offer a magic erasy board that only requires the manipulation of iron to draw your thoughts. Messages are photographed and hung monthly, as shown in the photo.</p>
